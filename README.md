# task07_2
Second part of seventh task in **[EPAM BelSUT Training](https://github.com/Sharibo-EPAM-BelSUT-Training)**.

I learned recursion, recursive file renaming. Program creates recursively a renamed folders (ADC_ + original name) in [```/out```](https://github.com/Sharibo-EPAM-BelSUT-Training/task07_2/tree/master/src/main/java/gmail/alexejkrawez/out) directory, changes contents of files and saves each file in the renamed subdirectory in [```/out```](https://github.com/Sharibo-EPAM-BelSUT-Training/task07_2/tree/master/src/main/java/gmail/alexejkrawez/out) (with \_ADC\_ in name of file). The program prints every renamed folder and every renamed file with hierarchical indent in console.

I have created a multithreaded version of this program, see: [task07_2_alternative](https://github.com/Sharibo-EPAM-BelSUT-Training/task07_2_alternative).
